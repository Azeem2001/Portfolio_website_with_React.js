                    <p>I believe in teamwork. I believe a group of people who work together can accomplish really big goals. When people work together and encourage each other great things happen.</p>
                    <p>Working in teams increases collaboration and allows brainstorming. As a result, more ideas are developed and productivity improves. Two or more people are always better than one for solving problems, finishing off difficult tasks and increasing creativity.</p>
